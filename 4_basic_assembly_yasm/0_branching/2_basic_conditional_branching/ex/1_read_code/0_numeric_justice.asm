; 1.    How many inputs does this program expect?
;
; 2.    Try to give different inputs to this program, and check the results.
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand it. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can.
;       
;       Note that the relevant part of the code is from the "start" label until
;       the [ExitProcess] call invocation. You do not need to read the input and
;       output subroutines.
;       
; 4.    Pick some random inputs and verify your predictions about what this
;       program does.
