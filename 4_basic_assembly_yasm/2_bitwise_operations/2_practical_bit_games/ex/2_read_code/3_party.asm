; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
; 
; 1.    How many inputs does this program expect?
;
; 2.    Try to give different inputs to this program, and check the results.
;       Particularly: Check the results you get for the following inputs:
;       0,1,2,4,8,ffffffff
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. Add comments if needed.
;       
; 4.    What is the largest output that you have managed to get from the program?
;       What is the largest possible output? Can you find a way to reach it?
